# TaxoDrift

**TaxoDrift** is a project aimed at analyzing and understanding the phenomenon of taxonomic drift and nomenclature changes in botanical research. This repository explores how taxonomic databases evolve over time and provides tools and methodologies to manage these changes effectively.

## Overview

In botanical research, taxonomic names change frequently due to new discoveries, updated classifications, and revised nomenclature rules. This project focuses on the following aspects:

- Identifying and understanding taxonomic drift across different database versions.
- Analyzing the impact of nomenclature changes on data standardization.
